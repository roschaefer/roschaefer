Hi! :wave: I'm Robert and I develop full-stack applications since 2012. Starting with Ruby on Rails I moved to SPAs and NodeJS with a preference for Vue, Nuxt, GraphQL and Apollo. I am a Free and Open-Source enthusiast and like to speak e.g. at tech meetups. Besides that I enjoy mentoring and give courses at university about full-stack development. I prefer to test-drive my code when possible. My interests at the moment are TypeScript, Golang and Flutter.
